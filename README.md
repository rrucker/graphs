# graphs
This starts with a graphframes program that uses a databricks example as a template. The program
uses sbt and there is an build.sbt file that calls out the needed jars from the mvnrepo.
( I actual;ly didn't use plotly in this first example. Note that graphframes is not part of 
the m,ain spark modules but is evolving independently ( see the build file to see its callout, )
